# Stuff I Use

## System Software

 - **Laptop**: Arch Linux with KDE Plasma 5 on X11 and another Arch setup with GNOME on Wayland
 - **Phone**: Android 10 custom ROM, rooted with Magisk
 
## Laptop Essentials (for me)

### Desktop Customization

 - **Latte Dock**: Using it as a panel too with a heavily customized configuration based on the built-in Unity configuration. Also using Window Title, Window AppMenu and Window Buttons widgets.
 - **Color Schemes**: Mainly the default Breeze Dark but using separate color schemes for different programs to blend in with the UI, eg: Electron-based applications, Tauon Music Player, Chromium, etc.
 - **Window Decorations**: Breeze Dark, but with the gradient and the circle on the close button disabled.
 - **Plasma Style**: Elegant
 - **Application Style**: Breeze Dark
 - **Icon Theme**: Papirus-Dark
 - I'm also writing a script to switch between dark and light mode across the entire UI. Yes, I know Yin-Yang exists, but it never worked for me.

### Network

 - **Ungoogled Chromium** - As much as I hate Google, their browser is sadly the best right now on Linux (I love Firefox but call me once VAAPI acceleration, Web-wide dark mode, better touchpad smooth scrolling, etc hits Linux)
 - **qBittorrent** - The best torrent client on any desktop platform right now.

### Anime

 - **Trackma** - A native alternative to Taiga on Windows. Works amazingly well and the code is neat too.
 - **MPV** - The best media player right now, no need for any front end or anything of the sort.

### Manga

 - **Komikku** - A GNOME application made to read Manga. Built with the Librem 5 Linux phone in mind, but works equally well on Linux desktops. It's still in an early stage of development but it's already amazing. I also have a custom patchset of sorts that makes the experience kinda better for me. It needs a lot of work before submitting a merge request though. A few features and fixes have been merged so far but the rest still need a lot of work before I submit them.
 - **TachiWeb** - I like the "idea" of being able to sync with my Tachiyomi on phone and being able to use the same extensions is also great. But TachiWeb's sync is not yet working and the application's UI, especially the lack of a dark mode, basically kills it for me. So, while I do have it installed, it's mostly a project I'm watching.

### Development

 - **Code OSS** - The OSS version of Visual Studio Code as packaged for the Arch repo.
 - **Android Studio** - Well, no other choice here really. But I haven't really begun working on anything yet anyway.
 - **PyCharm** - PyCharm is really good with coding standards and I often use it to check my code and fix any issues mostly. Really amazing code analysis.
